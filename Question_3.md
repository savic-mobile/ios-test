# iOS Login UI

Write an iOS code that creates a **login UI** with two text fields. 

The first  text field is for the **username**, while the second one is for the **password**. 

Upon pressing the login button, the code should validate the inputs, and if the validation passes, 

it should show a **Alert** message indicating **successful login**. However, 

if the validation fails, the code should show a **Alert message** stating the **errors**.


## Note:
- Use swift programming language.
- Apply basic design for Login UI
- Adhere to coding standards.
